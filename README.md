## Setup and Installation
These instructions assume you're using Mac OSx.

### Basic Setup
You will need to have these tools installed on your machine. They may already be installed - see the 'Confirm installation' sections below.

### Install Node JS:
This uses Homebrew:  

```
$ brew install node
```
#### Confirm installation:

```
$ node -v
(should return something like: v11.6.0)

$ npm -v
(should return something like: 3.10.5)
```
### Install TypeScript:
This uses Node Package Manager (npm) which was installed in the previous step:
```
$ npm install typescript -g
```
#### Confirm installation:
```
$ tsc -v
(should return something like: Version 2.1.4)
```

### Install Angular:
```
$ npm install -g @angular/cli@1.6.5
```

### Confirm installation:
```
$ ng -v
```
You should get something like this in return:
```
    _                      _                 ____ _     ___
   / \   _ __   __ _ _   _| | __ _ _ __     / ___| |   |_ _|

/_/   \_\_| |_|\__, |\__,_|_|\__,_|_|       \____|_____|___|
               |___/

Angular CLI: 1.6.5
Node: 8.8.1
OS: darwin x64
Angular:
...
```

### OPTIONAL :: Install the Atom-TypeScript package:

```
$ apm install atom-typescript
```

Fork the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/skillitzimberg/WhatsUpDoc).  
Clone your forked repository.  

Use your preferred command line/terminal to navigate into the directory:
```
cd ua-clone/
```

Open the project in a text editor like Atom or VS Code.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
