# Project Planning

## Purpose
To 'clone' as closely as I can the Under Armour website.

## Setup Instructions
- [x] SETUP.md  

## Assignment Objectives
- [ ] Project includes a detailed README with information on all completed features as well as features to be added.
- [ ] Project includes a detailed commit history that clearly shows at least eight hours of work between 8 and 5 on Friday. You are also welcome to put additional work into your project outside of that time frame.
- [ ] Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

## Planned Homepage Components

- [x] Secondary Row
- [x] Social (for Social Shop)

## Unforeseen To Do's
- [x] refactor homepage to use routing and router-outlet. I will need to create an Index Component, I think.

## Build Out Guidelines
* More directives (practice with ngIf, ngFor, and more).
* Full CRUD functionality that changes your models.
* Firebase (a noSQL database) instead of a hard-coded dataset.
* Seed data for your database.
* Pipes for filtering data.
* A router for adding additional pages.
* Authentication and route guards.
* Deployment (as a dry run for next week).
* API calls.
* CSS styling.
* Tests using Jasmine and Protractor.
* Built-in or custom pipes for filtering data.
* A router for adding additional pages.
* Authentication and route guards.
* API calls.
* CSS styling.
* Tests using Jasmine and Protractor.
* README styling such as screenshots and GIFs.
* Anything else you can think of to make this a strong portfolio piece!

## Work Log (to track work done without code written)
- 10 am - researching node_modules/@types/jasmine/index.d.ts errors that I'm getting when trying to run Jasmine tests on the basic project delivered using Angular CLI. It looks like it may be a versioning issue between Jasmine & TypeScript. I don't know yet.  

- 10:15 am - dissecting UA website's html/css in preparation for building out the store components.

## Planning Guidelines (for my own reference)

1. Configuration/dependencies
  * This should include ALL dependencies.
  * It should also include WHERE they are defined and used in the project
  * It could include a short description of what each does for you

3. Integration
  * Initial routes or index pages with all dependencies in Controller/index.html head
  * Template/html page for ...
  * Template/html page for ...
  * Template/html page for ... (one for each route/integrated user story)
  * Display...
  * Integrate feature that...

4. UX/UI
  * Include and modify bootstrap/materialize/Sass etc.
  * Develop custom style

5. Polish
  * Refactor minor portion of...
  * Delete unused...
  * Make README awesome
